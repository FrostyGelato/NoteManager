# My CPSC 210 Project

## Proposal
My project will be a notes management application. **It will keep track of notes scattered across a filesystem and provide easy access to notes related to a certain topic.** The application will link to the note files but will not store the actual files. The notes will be grouped by topics, which in turn are grouped by subject. A note file can be present under more than one topic, and a topic can contain multiple note files.

**It is mainly intended for students that take notes by computer.** As a student that mainly takes notes on computers and never deletes them, I sometimes find that I already have prior notes on a subject I am learning about. Instead of writing entirely new notes, I would like to build upon my previous notes. However, **my notes are usually scattered across multiple folders, and I have trouble recalling their location**. There are several other reasons why I want to build this application:
- In class, I donâ€™t have the time to manually search for certain notes.
- Some of my notes are in third-party file formats that the system search is unable to index.
- System search brings up too many irrelevant results.

## User Stories
- As a user, I want to be able to add a subject to a list of subjects
- As a user, I want to be able to view a list of my subjects
- As a user, I want to be able to remove a subject
- As a user, I want to be able to add a topic to a subject
- As a user, I want to be able to view a list of topics in a subject
- As a user, I want to be able to remove a topic from a subject
- As a user, when I select the quit option from the application menu, I want to be reminded to save my lists of subjects, topics, and notes to file and have the option to do so or not.
- As a user, when I start the application, I want to be given the option to load my lists of subjects, topics, and notes from file.
